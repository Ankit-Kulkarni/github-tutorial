Hello friends,
This is a basic presentation tutorial repository conducted on 20 Jan 2014 at IIPS - DC .  I am constantly adding changes to this repository . Those who are interested , can clone this repo and check for changes via `git pull` from time to time.

I am soon planning to add a full-fleged all-in-one presentation for any newbie.
